- **Risk Guardian**: Manages position sizing and risk
- **Structure Validator**: Multi-timeframe analysis
- **POI Scanner**: Finds Order Blocks, FVGs, Breakers

### 3. Strategies
- **Prometheus**: Vector-based pattern matching
- **Wyckoff**: Accumulation/Distribution phases
- **MAZ**: Unmitigated level strategy
- **London/NY**: Session-based reversals

### 4. Vector Operations
- Everything converts to embeddings
- Similarity search for pattern matching
- In-memory vector store per session
- Confidence scoring based on historical patterns

## How to Use

### Initial Setup
1. The bootstrap automatically loads on startup
2. Check initialization status with the bootstrap
3. Use the menu system to navigate features

### Processing Data
1. User provides external data files (CSV, JSON)
2. System loads from `/data` directory
3. Enriches with indicators and vectors
4. Runs multi-agent analysis
5. Generates confluence-based signals

### Trading Workflow
1. **Analyze**: Multi-timeframe structure analysis
2. **Identify**: Find POIs and liquidity zones
3. **Confluence**: Stack multiple confirmations
4. **Signal**: Generate trade with entry/stop/targets
5. **Vector Match**: Compare to historical winners

    "data_file": "XAUUSD_ticks.csv"
})

# Display menu
menu = system["menu"].display()
```

## Important Notes

1. **Session-Based**: No data persists between conversations
2. **External Data**: All market data comes from user files
3. **Vector-Native**: All operations use embeddings
