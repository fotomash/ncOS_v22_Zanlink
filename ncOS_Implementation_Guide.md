# ncOS v23 Implementation Guide

## Files Created:
1. `ncos_bootstrap_enhanced.py` - Main bootstrap with session persistence
2. `session_state_manager.py` - Handles saving/loading session state
3. `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS_ncOS_v23.md` - Full GPT system instructions
4. `ChatGPT_Custom_Instructions_ncOS.txt` - User custom instructions

## Setup Steps:

### 1. For Custom GPT:
- Upload all Python files to the GPT
- Paste the contents of `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS_ncOS_v23.md` into the GPT instructions
- Set the GPT to automatically execute `ncos_bootstrap_enhanced.py` on startup

### 2. For ChatGPT:
- Go to Settings â†’ Custom Instructions
- Paste the contents of `ChatGPT_Custom_Instructions_ncOS.txt`
- Upload the bootstrap files when starting a conversation3decide 

### 3. Configuration:
The system will automatically:
- Create `session_state.json` on first run
- Load previous state on subsequent runs
- Save state after important actions

## Usage Examples:

### First Time:
```
You: hi
GPT: [Shows full initialization and dashboard]
```

### Returning User (same day):
```
You: hi
GPT: Welcome back! Last session: 2 hours ago
     XAUUSD moved from 3358.50 â†’ 3361.20
     Your setup at 3357.50 is still active
     Ready for commands!
```

### Returning User (next day):
```
You: hi
GPT: Welcome back! Last session: yesterday
     ðŸ“Š Major updates:
     â€¢ XAUUSD tested and rejected 3370 resistance
     â€¢ Your long from 3357.50 hit TP at 3365 âœ“
     â€¢ New support formed at 3355

     Want to scan for new setups?
```

### Quick Commands:
```
You: scan
GPT: [Immediate market analysis]

You: update
GPT: [What changed since last check]

You: continue
GPT: [Resumes last analysis type]
```

## Key Features:

1. **Persistent Memory**
   - Remembers all discussed levels
   - Tracks identified setups
   - Saves user preferences
   - Maintains conversation context

2. **Smart Context**
   - References previous discussions naturally
   - Alerts to changes in monitored setups
   - Suggests relevant actions based on history

3. **No Setup Required**
   - Works immediately on "hi"
   - No menus or numbered choices
   - Instant market readiness

4. **Automatic State Saving**
   - After each analysis
   - When setups are identified
   - When preferences change
   - Every 5 minutes during use

## Troubleshooting:

If session doesn't load:
- Check if `session_state.json` exists
- Manually run: `from session_state_manager import SessionStateManager; session = SessionStateManager()`
- Use `session.create_new_session()` to reset

To clear history:
- Delete `session_state.json`
- System will create fresh session

To backup state:
- Copy `session_state.json` to safe location
- Can restore by copying back

## Advanced Features:

### Checkpoints:
```python
session.checkpoint("Important market turning point")
```

### Manual State Update:
```python
session.update_market_context("XAUUSD", {
    "htf_bias": "BULLISH",
    "key_levels": {"resistance": [3370], "support": [3355]}
})
```

### Add Custom Notes:
```python
session.state['conversation_context']['important_notes'].append(
    "User prefers tight stops during news events"
)
session.save_state()
```

This creates a truly persistent trading assistant that never forgets!
